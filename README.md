# ChordScale

This is the ChordScale App; an application designed to help anyone and everyone understand how music works and, more importantly, how to become fluent on your instrument by prodiving the user with both the visual note-name data specific to the chord (dependent on context) and the sounds/frequencies that are associated with these notes. The synchronicity between what you hear in your head / what you actually hear, the knowledge of what you can use these sounds for in certain situations, and the physical action of playing these notes/sounds on your particular instrument(s) is what leads to understanding and musical fluency!

Hosted here via Firebase: https://chord-scale.web.app/

As of Oct 14, 2024:
  - Updates have been made to properly deploy to Firebase

  - Considering rebuilding in seperate repository with new assets and software packages
    - Need to use legacy versions of Node and Angular in order to still function
      
  - Future Goals: 
      - Add more scales & chord-types
      - Connect Contact Form to appropriate storage
